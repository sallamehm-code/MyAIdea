# SMS Fraud Shield

## Summary
SMS Fraud Shield is an AI system designed to detect and block "Smishing" (SMS Phishing) attacks. It identifies fraudulent messages aiming to steal sensitive personal information by analyzing text patterns.

## Background
SMS-based scams are a global threat. Many users fall victim to deceptive messages that appear to be from legitimate banks. This project aims to reduce financial fraud by providing an automated layer of security.

## Data sources and AI methods
The project uses the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset from the UCI Repository. 
Methods include:
* **TF-IDF:** To evaluate word importance.
* **Naive Bayes:** To calculate the probability of "fraud" based on word frequencies.



## Challenges
* **Evolving Tactics:** Fraudsters use special characters to bypass filters.
* **Privacy:** Handling private messages requires high encryption and ethical standards.

## What next?
The goal is to develop a real-time mobile app plugin that warns users before they click suspicious links and supports multiple languages.

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by the **Building AI** course by the University of Helsinki.
